# For_Posterity
 A collection of old projects that don't necessarily demonstrate my current abilities in Data Science but that I'd like to preserve. 
 
 ## Pokemon Project
 My first ever Data Science "project." It consists of 11 Exercises and their solutions all solved via EDA. Dataset was from kaggle.  
 Project was a part of a weeklong bootcamp with Ted Petrou at [Dunder Data](https://www.dunderdata.com/) in May of 2019. This 
 was my first exposure to Data Science and a week I'll never forget.
